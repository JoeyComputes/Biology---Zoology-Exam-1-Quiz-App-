Required Dependencies : 

Python 3.x or later

  Step 1: Visit the Python website at https://www.python.org/.
  Step 2: Download the latest version of Python (3.x) for Windows.

Tkinter

  Step 1: Open the Command Prompt by pressing Win + R and typing cmd. Hit Enter.
  Step 2: In the Command Prompt, type python and hit Enter to launch the Python interpreter.
  Step 3: Once the interpreter starts, type "import tkinter" and hit Enter.
  Step 4: If there are no error messages, Tkinter is already installed on your system.

If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using the following steps:

  Step 1: Visit the Python website at https://www.python.org/.
  Step 2: Download the latest version of Python (3.x) for Windows.
  Step 3: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard.
  Step 4: Make sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option during the installation.
  Step 5: Once the installation is complete, open the Command Prompt and verify the installation by typing "import tkinter".

2. macOS - Tkinter is usually pre-installed on macOS systems. To check if it's available, follow these steps:

  Step 1: Open the Terminal application.
  Step 2: In the Terminal, type python or python3 and hit Enter to start the Python interpreter.
  Step 3: Type import tkinter and hit Enter.
  Step 4: If no errors occur, Tkinter is already installed.

In case Tkinter is missing, you can install it by following these steps:

  Step 1: Open the Terminal application.
  Step 2: Install Python 3 (if not already installed) using Homebrew by running the command: "brew install python".
  Step 3: Once Python is installed, check the version by typing "python3 --version".
  Step 4: If Python 3 is installed, Tkinter should be available by default.

Usage:
1. Launch the app
2. Answer the questions and pick one of the 4 answers you think is correct!
